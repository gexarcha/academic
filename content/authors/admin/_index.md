Georgios is a Research Scientist (Chargé de recherche) at [IHU Strasbourg](https://www.ihu-strasbourg.eu/). Until January 2021 he was a postdoctoral researcher at  [Institut de la Vision](http://www.institut-vision.org/). Previously, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [Prof. Dr. Stephane Mallat](https://www.di.ens.fr/~mallat/)’s [DATA](https://www.di.ens.fr/data/) team at École Normale Supérieure. He received the degree of Dr. rer. nat. from the University of Oldenburg on 01.11.2016. During his doctoral studies, he worked with [Prof. Dr. Roland Memisevic](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~memisevr/) at the University of Frankfurt (2012-2013), [Prof. Dr. Bruno Olshausen](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/people/bruno-olshausen/) at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley (2013-2014), and [Prof. Dr. Jörg Lücke](https://uol.de/en/machine-learning/) at the University of Oldenburg(2014-2016). He holds an M.Sc. in Computational Science from the Department for Theoretical Physics of Frankfurt University and a Diploma from the Mathematics Department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

His research interests revolve around sparse coding, graphical models, signal processing, deep learning, and theoretical neuroscience. He has studied their applications primarily on spike sorting, receptive field estimation, quantum chemistry, and natural image statistics.
