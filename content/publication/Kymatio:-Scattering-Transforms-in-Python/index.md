abstract: The wavelet scattering transform is an invariant signal representation
  suitable for many signal processing and machine learning applications. We
  present the Kymatio software package, an easy-to-use, high-performance Python
  implementation of the scattering transform in 1D, 2D, and 3D that is
  compatible with modern deep learning frameworks. All transforms may be
  executed on a GPU (in addition to CPU), offering a considerable speed up over
  CPU implementations. The package also has a small memory footprint, resulting
  inefficient memory usage. The source code, documentation, and examples are
  available undera BSD license at this https URL
