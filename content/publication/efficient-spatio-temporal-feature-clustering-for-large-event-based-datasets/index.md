abstract: Event-based cameras encode changes in a visual scene with high
  temporal precision and low power consumption, generating millions of events
  per second in the process. Current event-based processing algorithms do not
  scale well in terms of runtime and computational resources when applied to a
  large amount of data. This problem is further exacerbated by the development
  of high spatial resolution vision sensors. We introduce a fast and
  computationally efficient clustering algorithm that is particularly designed
  for dealing with large event-based datasets. The approach is based on the
  Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and relies on a stochastic
  approximation of the E-step over a truncated space to reduce the computational
  burden and speed up the learning process. We evaluate the quality, complexity,
  and stability of the clustering algorithm on a variety of large event-based
  datasets, and then validate our approach with a classification task. The
  proposed algorithm is significantly faster than standard k-means and reduces
  computational demands by two to three orders of magnitude while being more
  stable, interpretable, and close to the state of the art in terms of
  classification accuracy.
