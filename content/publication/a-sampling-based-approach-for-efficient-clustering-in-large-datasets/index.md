  We propose a simple and efficient clustering method for high-dimensional data
  with a large number of clusters. Our algorithm achieves high performance by
  evaluating distances of datapoints with a subset of the cluster centres. Our
  contribution is substantially more efficient than k-means as it does not
  require an all to all comparison of data points and clusters. We show that the
  optimal solutions of our approximation are the same as in the exact solution.
  However, our approach is considerably more efficient at extracting these
  clusters compared to the state-of-the-art. We compare our approximation with
  the exact k-means and alternative approximation approaches on a series of
  standardised clustering tasks. For the evaluation, we consider the algorithmic
  complexity, including the number of operations to convergence, and the
  stability of the results.
